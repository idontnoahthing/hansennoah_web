          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
              Greetings! My name is Noah, and I'm excited to share some things about myself. I was fortunate enough to grow up in Davis County, Utah, with two brothers and a sister. My family means the world to me, and I enjoy spending time with them.
            </p>
          <p>
              I tied the knot with my beautiful wife Rylee in October 2022. She's my partner in everything, and I'm beyond grateful to have her in my life. We have big plans for the future and can't wait to take on new adventures together.
            </p>
          <p>
              In terms of my career, I currently work as a Global Technology Specialist with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It's a job that's both rewarding and challenging, as I get to help people with their accounts and always be learning and adapting in a constantly changing environment. I always strive to improve my skills and knowledge in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
              Beyond work, I have a diverse set of hobbies that keep me entertained. Photography is one of my favorite pastimes, as I love capturing the world through my camera lens. I'm also light gamer, but mostly enjoy playing with family and friends. When I'm not indoors, I'm usually out in nature, hiking or camping. Lastly, I am an amateur 3-D designer making solutions for problems at home and on the go, 3-D printing those designs.
          </p>
          <p>
              That's a bit about me! I'm a friendly and outgoing person who enjoys meeting new people and finding new opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about who I am!
          </p>
